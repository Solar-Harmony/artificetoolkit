# Change Log:
## 2.4.1
- Fix: Optimized abstract list view of artifice for better event subscriptions and overall improvements. Undo-redo was previously causing slow editor times previously.

## 2.4.0
- Enhancement: Added native light and dark Unity Editor theme support across Artifice inspectors, custom attributes, editor windows, the Inspector Header, Validator, toolbar integration, and iconography.
- Enhancement: Group colors now use adaptive semantic surfaces while preserving the existing `GroupColor` API, and parameterless borders follow Unity's active theme without changing explicitly supplied colors.
- Enhancement: Added examples for all attributes to `Artifice_ExampleForArtificeAttributes`.

## 2.3.3
- Enhancement: `SerializedDictionary` now allows duplicate keys in the editor (functioning like a plain list) and provides real-time visual warnings for them. Duplicates are safely skipped during deserialization to maintain dictionary integrity.
- Enhancement: Now selecting a validator type filters additionally for that selected type. "Escape" cancels the selection. 
- Fix: Fixed an issue in `Artifice_EditorWindow_Validator` where clicking on items in the Validator Types list would incorrectly select elements above them.
- Fix: Now non-applicable attributes also show their type name.

## 2.3.2
- Fix: Added empty custom attribute drawer for `SortAttribute` to skip warning of non-existing drawer.

## 2.3.1
- Fix: Corrected namespace of `Artifice_CustomAttributeDrawer_VerticalGroupBeginAttribute`, conflicting with default Editor namespace.

## 2.3.0
- Enhancement: Added new system to add Group attributes using `Begin` and `End` typology. See section `Group Begin and Group End attributes` of README.
- Fix: Validator Modules now skip size property of arrays. This was resulting to unwanted validation logs.
- Fix: Horizontal and Vertical groups are now always transparent.

## 2.2.4
- Fix: Added margin for `InlineObject` on materials
- Fix: Fixed `Required` not triggering on class declaration and arrays.
- Fix: Added a more clear LogMessage for validator logs, including the name of the property.
- Fix: Now toggle buttons for validator window are always correctly updated.

## 2.2.1
- Fix: Now `ButtonAttribute` can also fetch from private methods. Now it uses the exact same logic as `Button` for fetching `MethodInfo` based on method name.
- Fix: Minor change to the way validator stores and caches the validator logs. After the first cycle has completed, the list will not refresh until the next cycle has ended with the updated logs.

## 2.2.0
- Enhancement: Create `ArtificeElement` runtime struct. This is an empty struct memory-wise and visually. Its purpose is to serve as a structural element for various attributes. It's main use is the new `ButtonProxy` attribute. 
- Fix: In the previous versions, only `Button` and `BoxGroup`-like attributes worked on methods. Even this was done with heavy manual work. The main reason is that artifice is build around `SerializedProperties` which methods just aren't. So make the system more future proof, the runtime struct `ArtificeElement` is introduced, serving as a proxy for everything layout-wise. Learn more on the `ButtonProperty` section of README.
- Fix: Now `Artifice_Validator`'s asset-related search is always narrowed down through `ValidatorModule.Configuration` under Assets. This was changed due to unpredictable behaviour with 3rd party assets. 

## 2.1.0
- Fix: Now validator window fetches all the logs upon opening.
- Enhancement: Refactored the settings of the validator so that each validation module can have its own overriden configurations. A list of asset folders can be set, and validations which follow the code guidelines will only iterate over these subfolders.

## 2.0.0
Artifice has now entered its 2.0.0 version, which means it is breaking for previous versions. The breaking changes are minor and are almost exlcusive to namespace naming conventions so they are easy to fix. Sorry for the inconvenience.

- Fix: Corrected wrong namespaces assigned in various places. There is now a single `ArtificeToolkit.Attributes`. Previously there were two namespaces for the same group of attributes.
- Fix: Labels now appear as expected within `HorizontalGroup` and `VerticalGroup`, allowing for better structures.
- Fix: The `Button` attribute now works as expected within the `InlineProperty` attribute.
- Fix: Now the `ViewPersistenceKey` is not mandatory for `ArtificeMenuEditorWindow`. If not set, the window will always default back to the first page when opening.
- Enhancement: Updated the Artifice Wizard to be an `ArtificeMenuEditorWindow` for better structure and to serve as an example for people who want to learn more about this feature.
- Enhancement: Refactored the artifice example using Scriptable Objects to showcase the power of the `ArtificeMenuEditorWindow`.
- Enhancement: Added `LayoutPercent` and `LayoutPixels` attributes which allow control over the width and height of their wrapped/child elements.
- Enhancement: Added an option to `InlineObject` to always be expandable through the constructor.


## 1.9.4
- Fix: Now `InlineObject` and `PreviewScriptable` bind properly to the expanded container fixing the issue of missing composite properties like `Vector3`.
- Note: `PreviewScriptable` has been marked as Obsolete. Replace with `InlineObject` which supports both `ScriptableObject` and many more `UnityEngine.Object` types.

## 1.9.3
- Fix: Added flag to not dispose temporary scriptable objects through `CreateAndRegister` in `ArtificeMenuEditorWindow`.

## 1.9.2
- Fix: Various fixes around ArtificeMenuEditorWindow
  - Added InspectorElement to RenderContent for correctly aligned property rendering
  - Made changes to style of content container to have min to scroll content height
  - Added no-shrink USS to icons and label of menu items
  - Refactored ArtificeMenuTreeNode to use textures instead of sprites
- Fix: Reverted use of cached `ArtificeDrawer` reference in `ArtificeInspector`

## 1.9.1
- Fix: Updated mScript visibility logic to "IsVisible" to "ShouldHide" to respect Unity's default behaviour.
- Fix: Artifice Wizard was inheriting from `ArtificeEditorWindow` but it was using complete custom logic.

## 1.9.0
- Enhancement: Added `ArtificeMenuEditorWindow`, a powerful way to create dynamic editor window toolboxes.  

## 1.8.0
- Enhancement: Added `InlineObject` and `InlineProperty` attributes.

## 1.7.1
- Fix: Reverted `SetSearchedComponentPrompt` public method of `Artifice_InspectorHeader_Dock` to allow 3rd party usage of search.

## 1.7.0
- Enhancement: Added `CategoryButtons` on `InspectorHeader`. It can be enabled/disabled from the `Artifice Wizard`.

## 1.6.26
- Fix: Added `IArtifice_ArrayAppliedAttribute` on `SafeTooltip` and corrected namespace of its custom attribute drawer.
- Fix: Fixed namespace of `Artifice_CustomAttributeDrawer_SafeTooltipAttribute`

## 1.6.25
- Fix: Minor refactor to naming of Abstract List View method to resolve unity warning.
- Enhancement: Refactored `Artifice_ValidatorModule_ScriptableObject_NullReferenceChecker` to work with all types of corrupted ScriptableObject asset.

## 1.6.24
- Fix: `UnityEngine.Tooltip` attribute was breaking rendering of Artifice lists. This was caused because unity uses a custom property drawer for the tooltip which somehow completely breaks the interaction with artifice. To avoid such issues, the `SafeTooltip` attribute has been added which has the exact same functionality as `Tooltip` but it works through Artifice.

## 1.6.23
- Fix: Corrected wrong Editor namespace.

## 1.6.22
- Enhancement: Added a list of additional minor features in `Artifice Wizard` menu. First and sole option for now is to make the `m_Script` property of `MonoBehaviours` to not be visible.
 
## 1.6.21
- Enhancement: Added `SerializedHashSet` type. Works and gets serialized as a plain list, but on runtime it is treated as a hashset. Artifice provides a property drawer to show conflict of entries.

## 1.6.18
- Fix: Now `ReadOnly` attribute works as expected for lists and arrays.

## 1.6.17
- Fix: Now `ForceArtifice` is included in the check to detect the usage of potential Artifice even in the children of a property. 

## 1.6.16
- Fix: Refactored `ResolveNestedMember` to work with `DeclaredOnly` binding flags fixing potential issues with `ValidateInput`.

## 1.6.15
- Enhancement: Added support for validation inclusion for user CustomAttributes. You can read more at the documentation under ExtraFeatures (9).

## 1.6.14
- Enhancement: Added warning error when `ApplyModifiedProperties()` fails on `ArtificeDrawer`.

## 1.6.13
- Fix: Added IsValid call on OnPrePropertyGUI of CustomAttributeDrawer_Validator_BASE to support custom LogMessages on the ArtificeDrawer as well.

## 1.6.12
- Enhancement: Refactored ReadOnly attribute to work with the intended functionality of UI Toolkit.

## 1.6.11
- Enhancement: Added an Wizard window which allows the user to turn on and off various features of the Artifice Toolkit he may not want in his project, like the validator toolbar. This can be further extended in the future for other potential "big" features.

## 1.6.10
- Fix: `EnableIf` now also works for inheritance from Template classes.

## 1.6.9
- Fix: Added Validator's toolbar support for Unity 6000.3 and higher.

## 1.6.8
- Fix: Refactored to support `EnableIf`'s reflection mode on serialized object level.

## 1.6.7
- Enhancement: Refactored `EnableIf` to work with reflected properties in the same scope as well as it worked with serialized properties. So now, you can use anything! In addition, when using `EnableIf` with only the property name as parameter, the default value of `true` is used for the comparison.  

## 1.6.6
- Enhancement: Updated `FindPropertyInSameScope` to also include backing fields.

## 1.6.5
- Enhancement: `ForceArtifice` is not a `CustomAttribute` anymore. Since it does not have a drawer, it was breaking the pattern, causing the need for unnecessary handling.

## 1.6.4
- Change: Changed visibility of validator log extension methods to be public for more accessible use.

## 1.6.3
- Enhancement: Now more clear logs are provided when an attribute has a missing drawer. 
- Enhancement: `Artifice_Utilities` now provide methods for logging.
 
## 1.6.2
- Fix: Now `Button` attribute will work correctly with a method's default parameters.
- Fix: Added pixel unit in USS to avoid minor warning on SerializedDictionary's stylesheet.

## 1.6.1
- Enhancement: Updated `Artifice_ValidatorModule_ScriptableObject_NullReferenceChecker` to only run for `/Assets`. This both saves performance and skips potential ValidatorLogs for assets user does not own.

## 1.6.0
- Enhancement: `CustomAttributes` from class definitions and implemented interfaces are now also fetched in `ArtificeDrawer`. With this change, it is possible to create attributes or validations which can be allied to classes. 

## 1.5.0
- Enhancement: Updated `Artifice_EditorWindow_Validator` to have scrollable logs.
- Enhancement: Updated `Artifice_Validator` to skip validator modules which are toggled off from the editor window. This allows you to focus on validations you actually care, saving performance.
- Enhancement: Added a validator module to check scriptable object's with corrupted null references. 

## 1.4.7
- Enhancement: Updated readme to include the `IsReplacingPropertyField` for overriding `OnPropertyGUI`

## 1.4.6
- Fix: Null reference exception would be thrown if Object had no script assigned. Now its indicated in the inspector as expected.

## 1.4.5
- Enhancement: Added `BuildUICompleted` event for artifice abstract list view.

## 1.4.4
- Fix: Added fix for edge case bug regarding serialized reference assignment.
- Fix: Added dependency for newtonsoft
- Fix: Corrected wrong namespace conflicting with unity's Editor namespace.

## 1.4.1
- Fix: Added fix for edge case bug regarding serialized reference assignment.

## 1.4.0
- Enhancement: Added `Artifice_InspectorHeader`. A simple utility header to help manage crowded inspectors by providing a searchbar, filtering and collapse/expand all components. 

## 1.3.27
- Enhancement: Added `ValidateJson` and `ValidateUxml` validation attributes.

## 1.3.26
- Enhancement: Aligned dropdown field of `SerializedReference` using `BaseField<object>.alignedFieldUssClassName`.  

## 1.3.25
- Enhancement: Previously you could only assign to the ignore list only `Components`. Now any type can be added to the ignore list and it will cause artifice to fallback to Unity's default rendering for that specific type. See the Menu > ArtificeToolkit > Ignore List.
- Enhancement: Small refactor was made in the `ArtificeDrawer` to allow the application of `CustomAttributes` even to ignored types. For example, using the default rendering for the `LocalizedString` class but being able to use it with `FoldoutGroup`.

## 1.3.24
- Fix: Button of base class now appears on inherited class as well. 

## 1.3.23
- Enhancement: Added a DefaultRenderingTypes set, to use default property field drawing, instead of letting artifice drawer iterate on them. Used for Vectors primarily.

## 1.3.22
- Enhancement: If a property is hidden by EnableIf, it is also ignored in the ValidatorModules.

## 1.3.21
- Enhancement: Now `Button` attribute works with multiple selected objects as well.

## 1.3.20
- Enhancement: Added `RunSynchronousValidation` method in `Artifice_Validator` to allow CI or build scripts to access and log potential validations.

## 1.3.19
- Fix: There was an issue with FoldoutGroups + ChildGameObjectOnly, causing only the first element to appear. Now it works as designed. Also now method Button and Groups work fine.
- 
## 1.3.18
- Fix: Now validator runs for disabled root gameobject's as well.

## 1.3.17
- Fix: Group attributes would break if used with specific wrapper attributes. Fixed now.

## 1.3.16
- Enhancement: Refactored `Artifice_EditorWindow_Validator`'s logs to set selection of inspector with one click only (previously was two).
- Enhancement: Fallback rendering from 2022.2 and newer, is now UI Toolkit rather than IMGUI. 
- Enhancement: When using SerializedReference for interfaces, when no properties exist in the interface, it does not render the extra foldout.
- Fix: Now custom attributes are applied to the serialized reference it self.

## 1.3.15
- Enhancement: Added `Artifice_ValidatorModule_ScriptableObject` which parses scriptable objects in the Assets and checks for custom attribute validations.

## 1.3.14
- Fix: SerializedReference with ForceArtifice for interface instantiation now skips interface and abstract types since they cannot be instantiated.

## 1.3.13
- Fix: Specifically for Unity 6, `EnableIf` was not working for elements created after the initial rendering.

## 1.3.12
- Fix: ArtificeToolkit no longer causes initial errors upon installation or reimport all.

## 1.3.11
- Enhancement: Now group attributes can be used with the `[Button]` attributes to affect the placement of method buttons.

## 1.3.10
- Enhancement: Added `ValidateInput` attribute which allows for easy in-script validations to be created on the spot.
- Fix: Fixed bug with `IArtifice_ArrayAppliedAttribute`
- Fix: Allowed `Artifice_CustomAttributeDrawer_Validator_BASE` inheritors to update the InfoBox as they see fit.
- Fix: Fixed bug with `Artifice_Validator` which would first cache the log and then call validate. That would was problematic in case of dynamic log messages per drawer. 

## 1.3.8
- Change: Added `IArtifice_ArrayAppliedAttribute` which is used to indicate whether an attribute should be applied to a property array or be injected on its children.

## 1.3.7
- Enhancement: Great performance boost for artifice drawer.
- Enhancement: Added `[ArtificeIgnore]` attribute.
- Enhancement: Added context action to ignore rendering specific scripts with `ArtificeDrawer`.
- Fix: Fixed problem where validator logs would glitch between appearing and disappearing.

## 1.3.5
- Fix: Hotfixed problem with CustomPropertyDrawer utility returning null in rare cases (like InputAction from Unity's InputSystem package). In this case, we fallback to a default `PropertyField` now.

## 1.3.4
- Fix: Copying and pasting an entire artifice list now works even if original copy has been disposed.

## 1.3.3
- Fix: SerializedDictionary did not work with long or some other types due to randmomization not being defined.

## 1.3.2
- Enhancement: Added [Sort] attribute which allows you to reorder rendering order of properties.

## 1.3.1
- Fix: Validator had an unnecessary force stop on hierarchy change to avoid disappearing gameObjects, but this was already covered with a targeted if clause on the same iteration.
- Enhancement: Added the option on the validator settings, to set a custom batching priority value.

## 1.3.0
- Enhancement: Heavily refactored `Artifice_Validator` in order to centralize batching and gathering of target objects to validate. To make the parsing logic simpler, `Artifice_ValidatorModule_GameObjectBatching` and `Artifice_ValidatorModule_SerializedPropertyBatching` requiring a single method to be overriden to apply validations.
- Enhancement: Added Null Script checker validation module, to immediately know when a script reference is lost.
- Change: Removed from validator the assets folders. They were draining performance and the attributes are not designed to support them. A common problem would be having a Required attribute on a prefab property which would have, by design, have to be filled after being placed inside another prefab.

## 1.2.0
- Enhancement: Added interface and abstract types serialization solution based on `SerializeReference` and `ForceArtifice``.
- Enhancement: Added OnValueChanged
- Fix: Corrected position of delete-element on artifice lists.

## 1.1.13
- Enhancement: Refactored Artifice Valdiator to be independent from the EditorWindow and runs persistently in the background while in autorun.
- Enhancement: Injected toolbar indicators for Artifice Validator on the top-left corner of Unity. On click, it toggles on/off the editor window of the validator for more details.

## 1.1.12
 - Fix: Added support on ChildGameObjectOnly attributes to also work on list elements.   

## 1.1.11
 - Enhancement: Added SerializedDictionary to runtime which works with all serializable types. Works with a specialized custom property drawer inherting from AbstractListView.
 - Enhancement: Updated documentation to include extra features section.
 - Fix: Added null checks and minor serialized property verification extension to avoid some errors.
 - Fix: Added persistency to Artifice_EditorWindow_Validator two pane split view. 


## 1.1.10
 - Fix: Bad namespace for Artifice_VisualElement_SlidingGroup caused conflicts with UnityEditor.Editor namespace.

## 1.1.9
 - Fix: Abstract List View would not apply attributes to children.
 - Fix: ChildGameObjectOnly would cause visual bug after list redraw.
 - Enhancement: Removed from Validator the drawer of scenes. It did not contribute to anything.
 - Enhancement: Updated Artifice_VisualElement_ToggleButton to support BindProperty.
 - Enhancement: Reversed Button parameter usage to be more usable, and fixed bug were it would not be able to close sliding panel afterwards.
 - Fix: Documentation menu item will now redirect user at the github page, showing the README.md
 - Change: Max/Min attributes have been converted to validations.
 - Change: ArtificeEditorWindow now has virtual method for CreateGUI, allowing you to extend it. It also immedietelly filters out unwanted unity serialized field.


## 1.1.8
 - Enhancement: Refactored ButtonAttribute to work with methods instead of proxy properties. 
 - Enhancement: Added sliging group visual element. Used in ButtonAttribute for cleaner inspector view
 - Enhancement: Some improvement on artifice list view performance 

## 1.1.7
 - Enhancement: Previously ArtificeDrawer would completely ignore custom property drawers in the project. Now, it queries and uses them if they exist!
 - Bug Fix: Previously in version 2022.X, when openning the validator window a bunch of warnings would show up. This is now fixed.
 - Enhancement: OnPropertyBound override for custom property drawers now works with 100% consistency.
 - Enhancement: Now ChildGameObjectOnly deletes the default unity object selector.
 - New Attributes: HideInArtifice, ReadOnly 
 - Documentation: Added documentation section on why order matterns + how to create your own custom attribute drawers.

## 1.1.5
 - Enhancement: Added ListElementNameAttribute which allows you to set a custom naming extension to your list elements based on sub-property string values.
 - Enhancement: Added context menu options (apply/revert to prefab, copy and paste) to Artifice's list view. Now, it also indicates with the blue indicator if lists have been detected on the list.

## 1.1.4
 - Refactor: Changed MenuItem name from ArtificeDrawer to ArtificeToolkit
 - Enhancement: Updated README.md with complete documentation and examples for each tested and used attribute with images and gifs.
 - Fix: Empty array using custom attributes was not rendering with artifice fixed.

## 1.1.3

- Enhancement: Now toggle button visual element can receive different sprites for each of its states. A example of this was implemented in the validator.

## 1.1.2

- Enhancement: Artifice Off now truly disables the toolkit. It disables the CustomEditor attribute on the artifice inspector, disabling its automatic replacement of the default editor. In addition, it will enforce the toggle option upon every domain reload. This ensures consistency when initializing or updating the package.
